## Project Description
### Problem
In 2021, the historically high rates of workers resigning from their jobs were like an alarm. Along with other factors, the resignations hinted at impeding the economy, which is always frightening to hear as a resident of this country. This phenomenon is known as The Great Resignation, a concept in which this project is focused on challenging. The data collected for this study was extracted from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, particularly from their Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey subjects, for the years 2017 through 2021. The scope expands on prior research, where the industries most impacted by the resignations were identified (Leisure/hospitality, education/health, manufacturing, trade/transportation/utilities). Through the analytics and algorithms efforts, including a dashboard built in Tableau and completing a Random Forest algorithm, the key finding was that open job vacancies are the largest indicator of resignations. Forecasting was also completed to project resignation and job vacancy rates over the next two years.

### Scope Overview
Since this is a topic that concerns quits in various industries throughout the United States, finding available data on those quits was a top priority. Through research, it was also discovered that wages were stated as a top reason for workers desiring to leave their current roles. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is branded as a great resource for data on labor activity, and, conveniently, there are data BLS has measured and collected in two of their subjects that prove relevant to the desired outcomes for this study. 

The first of the two subjects, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), is a program that publishes a quarterly count of employment and wages reported by employers covering more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs available. The second is the Jobs and Labor Turnover Survey, a monthly survey that has been developed to address the need for data on job openings, hires, and separations. This section will discuss what fields these two sources are comprised of and the most relevant ones for the study; their relevance to the study and additional context; the process of merging these files and an overall assessment on the data quality.  

### Summary of Efforts
This study used various regression algorithms to predict quit rate, including simple, multiple, and regularized linear regression models; a semi-reliable forecast using a linear regression function to predict monthly quit and job opening rates through the end of 2024; and a Tableau workbook deployed in Tableau Public to visualize the data effectively using a dashbaord. The findings from this study will influence future studies around labor market activity, particularly weighing quits against job openings.
